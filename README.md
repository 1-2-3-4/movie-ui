# movie-ui

To run locally: `npm i && npm run dev`

Areas for improvement given more time:
- unit tests
- feature tests
- loading screens / smoother initial render
- validation for url (UI only accounts for the past 5 years, but something like "/year/2002" will render)
- more attention to design / layout
